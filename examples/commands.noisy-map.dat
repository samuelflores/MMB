# In this example, we load in a tRNA density map.

# If we leave readPreviousFrameFile 1 (the default), then the ions at stage n will have the same coordinates as last.(n-1).pdb. So let's turn off structure file reading:
readPreviousFrameFile 0
# if we do stage 1, where readPreviousFrameFile is false, then monoAtoms will be adopted with an offset.
# We don't need the time integrator at all, in this case. We can't turn it off, so just numReportingIntervals to the minimum possible value:
numReportingIntervals 1
