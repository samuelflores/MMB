# In this example, we create a hairpin with a three base pair stem and a four base loop.
# You can compare this to the tetraloop found in the large subunit of the yeast mitochondrial ribosome, PDB ID 5MRC, residues 2639 to 2648.

# It's easier to avoid kinetic traps if we add the base pairs one at a time:
readFromStage 1

#This is the default setting anyway:
setHelicalStacking 1

#This is the force constant that applies to the NtC's:
NtCForceScaleFactor 20
# AA00 NtC's are automatically added when three or more WatsonCrick-WatsonCrick-Cis base pairs are found in a row, if setHelicalStacking = 1. Otherwise, you could add them explicitly as: 
#NtC  A 2656 2658  AA00
#NtC  A 2663 2665  AA00

# This is a multiplying factor for the baseInteraction forces:
forceMultiplier 2000
#This creates three WatsonCrick-WatsonCrick-Cis base pairs for the stated residue ranges:
nucleicAcidDuplex A 2656 2658 A 2665 2663
# Equivalently, you could add them base pairs individually:
#baseInteraction A 2656 WatsonCrick  A 2665 WatsonCrick Cis
#baseInteraction A 2657 WatsonCrick  A 2664 WatsonCrick Cis
#baseInteraction A 2658 WatsonCrick  A 2663 WatsonCrick Cis


# Turn on MD forces (incl. electrostatic and Lennard Jones forces) to prevent steric clashes:
setDefaultMDParameters
# But keep the Coulomb forces a bit weak, so the thing will fold without counterions:
