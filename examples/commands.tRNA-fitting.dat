# To run this example, issue:
# cp tRNA.pdb last.1.pdb
# also make sure you have tRNA.xplor in the current directory.
# And follow the tutorial guide!

# Set bondMobility for all residues in all chains (in this case there is only one) to Rigid:
mobilizer Rigid 

removeRigidBodyMomentum false

# This is constant that multiplies the density forces. In this case we leave it at the default value of unity:
densityForceConstant 1.00

# Next you need to fetch tRNA.xplor . I'm not providing this on github b.c. it's antisocial. You can do:
# wget http://pe1.scilifelab.se/MMB-annex//examples/tRNA.xplor .
# While you're there, you may admire other fine MMB documents and products.
# This file contains the density map in XPLOR format:
densityFileName ./tRNA.xplor

# This fits chain V to the density map:
fitToDensity V

# These parameters should be familiar by now:
temperature 1
numReportingIntervals 100
reportingInterval 1
